    <h1>Extras</h1>
    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There should always be three reserved characters:  &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use the HTML entities for these three characters, because they're commands and will mess up your code if typed normally even in a text context.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo:web typography, &rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit. They should hug the text.</p>
